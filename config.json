I need end users of the data to also agree to those restrictions. In particular, you must acknowledge both the CHIRILA database (see here how to do that) and the original source of the data you are quoting. By using this data, you agree to let me know of any errors you find. The original importing of data into the database was tricky (to say the least) and errors no doubt remain. The best way to get a wellcurated scholarly resource for Australian languages is for people to let me know when they come across issues, so that we can fix them for future releases.<br><br>If you need data in other formats for your research, please contact me. I may be able to produce a file in the format you need from the original (underlying) database more easily than you manipulating the output. If this requires substantial work on my part to achieve, I would ask to be included as a coauthor on the resulting paper.",
